# The structure
> I am making the content of this website in portuguese, but be aware that the code and comments are in english because that's how I like to work with conventions, it (SUBJECTIVELY) doesn't look right to me the concept of mixing comments and variable names from different languages and turn them into this amalgamation, I only write the content in portuguese.
> My views might change but I am clearly unstable and confused. :C

# The structure (for real now)
This website is composed out of "Cards", something microsoft would call "windows" or KDE would call widgets idk...

> this readme is a stub/placeholder, maybe even worse than a lorem ipsum
