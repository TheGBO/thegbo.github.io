            <p>
                This website is a mostly non-professional and personal "dump" of my:
            <ul>
                <li>thoughts;</li>
                <li>projects;</li>
                <li>media;</li>
                <li>ideas;</li>
                <li>software;</li>
                <li>resources;</li>

            <h1 class="card-title">Rewrite explanation</h1>
            <h2>Why the rewrite?</h2>
            <p>
            This is a rewrite and still is work in progress, I am also using english as some sort of de-facto
            language. The goal of this rewrite is to develop a personal website with better structure and organization,
            and that is: actual organization. While the old website looked modern and responsive, it was held together
            by legacy code I have written as a teenager back in 2022.
            Everything in this stage is extremely experimental, especially the CSS, it can fluctuate drastically, for instance, it can go from windows 95 looking UI to modern flat design, it is the very nature of an experiment.

            <h2>My views on generative AI/LLMs</h2>
            <p>
            I also want to quickly mention my views on artificial intelligence and how I use it for the sake of honesty:
            I do NOT use A.I. to write my texts nor do I use it as what the "cool kids" call "vibe-coding"; I try my
            best to actually learn the concepts behind what I am doing and this philosophy is applied to all my
            projects, but if I said that I didn't use it I would be straight up lying, here are my views (by the way, I
            do not enforce them against anyone, they are purely personal):
            <p>
                I personally think it is perfectly acceptable for me to use AI on:
            <ul>
                <li>Asking for help and getting quick bug fixes;</li>
                <li>Performance and optimization, this includes "asking if html code is semantically correct" too;</li>
                <li>Using it as an (unreliable) way to search and skim through documentation;</li>
                <li>Brainstorming vague technical ideas, such as how to set up a folder structure in a wise way;</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                I do not allow myself to:
            <ul>
                <li>Use products of AI image generation (I'd rather draw myself or use crappy placeholders). AI
                    Generated images are purely an experimental gimmick to me;</li>
                <li>Let it write text for me, because this kills the purpose of self expression (duh)</li>
                <li>Trust AI more than documentations themselves</li>
                <li>"Vibe-code", that is : letting it write code for me without my approval and active learning;</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            </p>

            <h2>Why english?</h2>
            <p>
            Sure portuguese was fine and allowed me to quickly share it with friends and people I have just met.
            However, this has proven to be unsustainable because my brain is somehow wired to automatically
            correlate
            the english language with technology, doing so in portuguese was feeling like some sort of mental
            friction.
            I am not doing this to
            show off my skills on a foreign language, it just feels natural to me in terms of self expression.
            Furthermore, if you are being able to directly read this in portuguese, that is due to some sort of
            translation tool
            I have embedded into this very website on a later stage of development.
